# How to run app after cloning/downloading it

#### 1. You need to have those tools installed on your PC

- Python (project written in version 3.8.1)
- pip (Python's tool to download libraries much easier)

After this step, you should be able to run statemets in your console and get information about installed versions:
- ```python```
- ```pip --version```

#### 2. With pip installed, you can type in command line (windows) or terminal (linux)

- ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

To download Flask library and opencv library (with dependencies)

#### 3. Open folder with downloaded project, and open terminal here. Then paste:

```python app.py```

to start app. You should see information with link, where the app (website) is running

#### UPDATE

Since dockerfile has been added, you can now just use Docker to create image and then run it!
